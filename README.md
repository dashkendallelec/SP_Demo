Here is an example of FactoryTalk Optix Studio widget development that uses the NuGet Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package to call a stored procedure in Microsoft SQL Server.
This also provides a callback to the PLC on the completion of the transaction.  The project includes a Studio 5000 ACD file that was used for testing the interface between
Optix, ControlLogix processor (using FactoryTalk Echo Simulation) and the database.  The database files and script for creation are also in the repository.

A detailed description of the project is available at: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/factorytalk-optix-stored-procedures-darren-ash-094he
